# Java Training #

## Introduction: ##

A collection of Java code samples for multiple modules and functionality of the Java programming language.

I hope you find these useful in preparation for the OCA and OCP certification exams from Oracle, or if you're simply starting with the Java language and wish to learn the basics (and a little of the more advanced topics).

Many of these code samples are inspired or based on the contents of Mala Gupta's excellent guide book [OCP Java SE 7 Programmer II Certification Guide](https://www.manning.com/books/ocp-java-se-7-programmer-ii-certification-guide). If you're interested in pursuing an Oracle Java certification path, please support the author and purchase the book, as it is without doubt the best and most accessible certification guide available.

All of the code in this repository is explicitly unlicensed and intended for educational purposes.

## Contents: ##

* ### [Assertions](/JavaTraining/src/assertions) ###

> Examples related to the `assert` keyword of Java and how to properly use it to test for invariants and control the correct flow of the code.

* ### [Class design](/JavaTraining/src/class_design) ###

> Examples of how to properly design Java classes and use access modifiers, inheritance and interface implementation. Proper overriding of `equals()` and `hashCode()`.

* ### [Collections](/JavaTraining/src/collections) ###

> Usage of the classes from the Java Collections framework, such as Lists, Maps, Sets and Deques. Usage of comparators.

> Applying thread-safe collection objects, Locks, Executors and Thread pools.

* ### [DAO](/JavaTraining/src/dao) ###

> Example of the DAO design pattern for establishing a relationship between Java classes and database entities.

* ### [Exceptions](/JavaTraining/src/exceptions) ###

> Proper usage of Exceptions to control error flow in using *try-with-resources* and *multi-catch*.

* ### [Factory](/JavaTraining/src/factory) ###

> Different variations of the Factory design pattern.
